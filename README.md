# Custom-Conv2D-layer-in-CNN

Trained a convolution neural network using PyTorch, wherein developed the conv2d layer from scratch. The scratch implementation included some variation in the model definition wherein the weight matrix was equivalent to the input size and was randomly initialized. Also, the receptive field will be selected as a weighted kernel instead of a same-weight kernel throughout the process.
